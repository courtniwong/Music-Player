Project 4: Music Player

This project was super fun! We created our very own iTunes, pretty awesome!

I worked with Rawan, India, and Brent on this project.

Resources I used include the textbook for the selection sort and GUI stuff. I referred to our past projects/labs
a lot for some of the methods I created in this lab that were similar to those I've written in the past. I also
got a lot of help from the TAs and I went to office hours for Joshi. 

Just a warning, my stop button kind of lags for a second or two after pressing it. But it works, I promise! :p

I attempted all of the extra credit which was SUPER difficult :( The search button was difficult because I received
a million errors and working with the table was pretty difficult. The XML format was definitely the hardest. 
I couldn't figure out how to do it and after surfing the web, I found this site: http://xstream.codehaus.org/tutorial.html
that gave a tutorial on how to format files to XML. The TA and I couldn't figure out how to make it work so we 
literally imported a million .jar files in hopes that it would work. And it finally did. Yay! The XML formatted 
document is created when the user presses the load library button. So there's a regular text file with the songs 
called mp3.txt and another textfile called XMLmp3s.txt that has the songs in XML format. 

I attempted the JFileChooser but it hampers with the GUI. If you uncomment the JFileChooser and JTextArea in the 
beginning of my MPlayerPanel and run the program, a window will pop up allowing you to open the mp3s.txt and 
XMLmp3s.txt files and view them in a separate screen. However, after exiting the window you will not be able to
go back to the music player so you would have to comment the JFileChooser and JTextArea code to view the music
player. Sorry for the trouble :(
